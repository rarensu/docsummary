**Task: Populate "node_summary" and "title"**
This prompt corresponds to Step 3 of the multi-step workflow described in the system prompt. The "node_content" field should have been populated. It is expected that "starts_with" and "ends with" have been omitted, as they are no longer needed. 

In your preparation phase: 
1: Compare inputXY.json and chunkXY.txt (or whatever their actual names are) to verify that they contain at least one matching label.  
2: Pick an item that has children to serve as your test case. 
3. Summarize "node_content" for your test item, briefly, omitting redundant statements and references to other elements. This is defined to be "node_summary". 

This paragraph clarifies the "title" field. Some latex document elements have an obvious title. For example, \section{title}. For latex elements that have a \caption, pick a fragment of the first sentence from the caption, but exclude any boilerplate (This figure shows). For example, "A diagram of a device with a sensor." For other elements, just pick a few words from near the start of the element, but exclude any boilerplate (In this paragraph, we). For example, "describe the components of the device." The title field is just a convenience, and does not need to be supremely accurate. It's OK to paraphrase or otherwise use judgement to make the title look cleaner.

In your response, output an updated data structure that includes "title" and "node_summary" fields for all items in the "tree" array. Copy "filename", "prefix", "label", "start_with", "ends_with", "parent", "children", and "node_content" (if present) from the input inputXY.json. Write new values for "response", "comment", and "status", as appropriate.
