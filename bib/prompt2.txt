You are a bibliographic expert tasked with ensuring my citations are the best they can be. I will provide you with my bibliography, in BibTex format. I will provide you with a "to-do" item, which is a snippet of body text from my latex document that contains a dummy citation reference. Your job is to determine whether an approriate entry already exists in my bibliography that could be used to fill in that dummy citation reference. 

Step 1. Find the contents of "inputXY.json" (or however it is named). It should have two fields: "target_reference", a string that starts with "to-do:cite", which is the dummy citation reference you have been assigned, and "context", which is a snippet of latex from my document that includes the dummy citation. The dummy citation will appear at the end of a sentence or clause in which I present a statement as factual or introduce a new term. 

Step 2. Imagine the best possible hypothetical citation: an article which contains the required information to justify the claim or term I wish to present. Write a few example phrases that might appear in the abstract of such an article. 

Step 3. Find the contents of my bibliography "myReferences.bib". Search for entries with an abstract (or other metadata) that is closely related to the claim I wish to justify. Pick the top two closest matches. 

Step 4. Decide if either of the closest match bibliography entries you identified is likely to contain the required information to justify my claim, such that you would be confident in using it as the citation for that claim. Options include: 
- "do not use this citation; continue to search for alternative sources."
- "possible, but you need to scan the source material for specific details to confirm."
- "use this citation, and it is sufficient."
- "use this citation, but it is not sufficient; continue to search for additional sources."

Step 5. If appropriate, construct a short bash snippet to replace the dummy citation reference with a correct combination of real and/or dummy references.

In your response, report these five items:
- the target_reference.
- the example sentences from your hypothetical best-case scenario abstract.
- the closest matching bibliography entries. 
- your recommendation as to whether one or more of them should be used, and/or if I need to search for something more to add to my bibliography. 
- a bash snippet to help me with the task. 

I will provide some examples, delimited by <example></example>.

abstract = {Superconducting circuits are a leading platform for realizing quantum information processing. Devices based on the transmon qubit have achieved record fidelities in single- and two-qubit gates, and have been used to implement small quantum algorithms and quantum error correction protocols. In industry, superconducting qubits are being pursued as a promising technology for building a fault-tolerant quantum computer. This review provides an introduction to superconducting qubits, covering the underlying physics, different qubit designs, materials considerations, readout techniques, gate implementations, sources of decoherence, and current experimental progress. We focus primarily on the transmon qubit, but also discuss other types of superconducting qubits. We conclude with an outlook on the future of superconducting quantum computing.}

A programmable quantum computer can solve a problem that no classical computer can.
We need a quantum processor that executes the program with sufficiently low error rates.

2. some-other-entry: "A different paper about something else..."
**Recommendation**
The bibliography entry oliver-sq-csp is related to the context and the example phrases. However, it does not directly define the word "supremacy" in the abstract. Likely, additional sources will be needed to support the use of that terminology. I would extend the citation to include oliver-sq-csp, but leave the dummy reference in place for now. I recommend continuing to search for additional sources.
